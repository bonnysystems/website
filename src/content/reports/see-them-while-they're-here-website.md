## preface

does your business have it's own website? many nowadays don't. with the advent of facebook, instagram, twitter / x, etc., lots of businesses don't find that there's a need for one, let alone even know what it is. even for those who do know what a website is, they opt out of creating one due to it's sheer complexity.

besides those reasons, there are other platforms that may serve a business in it's own, specific ways. for example with restaurants they could utilize doordash, grubhub, or ubereats. as well for doctors they may put themselves on zocdoc, psychology today, or vitals. these easy-to-use platforms are conveinent in that they have functionality that these businesses need (i.e. online ordering, reservations), so why bother with a website?

## discovery

how do people find your business online? google is probably what you're thinking, which is probably the case. search engines like google are very powerful in that you can have a direct influence on how your business shows up in it's search results. what is the most effective way to curate / optimize those results you may ask? a website.

although having a social media presence can help you be discovered on a search engine (i.e. google), nothing beats the power that a website gives you when it comes to discovery. with a website, you're in full control of what a search engine sees and understands. depending on what you place on your website, you can have it show up based on certain keywords, where new audiences may find your business.

## creativity

as stated previously, you are in charge of what goes on your website. you have full creative control. it's structure, content, every single part of it. this is not the case on social media platforms. yes, you may be able to change what "pictures" are seen on instagram, or what "tweets" are shown on twitter / X, but the form and structure of those are limited to what the platform abides you to.

with a website, you again have _full creative control_. this means that you can have photos shown in all different shapes or sizes (as opposed to instagram), or have blog posts that don't have to have any maximum character length (as opposed to twitter / X). you get to determine what your website displays because again, it's _yours_. similar to how you have your own home where you get to put what's up on your walls, same goes for your website. you can share whatever your heart desires. whether it's in the form of a blog post, image, video, or more.

## longevity

on top of all this, websites can last forever. it's up to you. that isn't the case with these (social media) platforms. websites have been around since the beginning of the web (90s), as opposed to these platforms. if we just look at the past, we could see how frail these platforms could be. myspace was the biggest social media platform, until it got taken over by facebook. facebook was then the biggest contender for a long time, until now where tiktok has blown it out of the water. as history has shown, it's only a matter of time before these "new-age" social media platforms come and go as well. that isn't the case for your own website.

## centralization

this isn't to say that social media doesn't have it's purpose. people still use them today, they still hold a level of importance. but is a platform that you don't even own, one that may go down at any moment, is that where you want your main platform to be? is that where you want your audience to find you? the beauty of a website is that you can link out to all your social media platforms. as new ones come, and as old ones go, you can update those links on your website at any time. a website is your online digital home.

## conclusion

the internet is a beautiful thing. it's what allows us to be able to connect with loved ones across the world, learn about any topic we want, and even meet with others virtually, all at our fingertips. along the way we've lost how to do this in a meaningful way, and have now resorted to using these platforms that don't really allow us to truly express ourselves. this is important as individuals but especially as businesses as well. and so for all of these reasons (and more), i believe that the most authentic way to express one self is through their own website.

that is one of the main reasons why i started <span class="bonny-text">bonny</span> <span class="systems-text">systems</span> this past year. i realized that a lot of local businesses don't have their own website and even if they do, aren't designed in a way that realizes it's full potential.
